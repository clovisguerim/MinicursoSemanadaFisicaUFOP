    "\n",
    "The solubility of materials is crucial to pharmaceutical applications such as formulating novel drugs. In this notebook, you will learn how to train deep learning models to predict the aqueous solubility of organic materials given their composition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The composition will be specified as SMILES strings, which are a convenient way to represent the structure of organic materials. You can learn more about SMILES strings [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system). We will use these SMILES strings as inputs to a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) and predict the solubility of organic materials. We will also learn how to train [variational autoencoders](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/variational-autoencoders/) to learn SMILES string representations. Variational autoencoders are models used to learn low-dimensional representations of a high-dimensional dataset, and in our case these models will give us a low-dimensional numerical representation of a SMILES string, which can replace the sparse matrices often used to represent data when using convolutional neural networks.\n",

For instance, the character 'C' in the SMILES string is converted to a vector of length 31, consisting of 30 zeros and one non-zero entry of one. The length of this vector (31 in our case) is the total number of unique characters in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string of 5 characters (say Pentane, which is represented as 'CCCCC'), we would thus get 5 vectors each of length 31. Since different molecules have different SMILES string lengths, we can pre-define the length of each string to be the maximum length from the database, with smaller molecules represented with additional characters. In our case, this maximum length is 40 and we represent the extra characters for smaller molecules with pre-defined one-hot vectors. This means that each molecule is now represented as a set of 40 vectors, each of length 31. We can represent this as a 40x31 matrix.\n",

Each molecule is represented by a 40x31 sparse matrix, the bright spots in the heatmap indicate the position at which a one is found in the matrix. For instance, the first row has a bright spot at index 18, indicating that the first character is 'C'. The second row has a bright spot at index 23, which indicates that the second character is 'O'. For the compound Dimethoxymethane with a SMILES string 'COCOC', we expect the matrix to have alternating bright spots at index 18 and index 23 for the first five rows. Beyond that, the rows all have a bright spot at index 1, which stands for the extra characters padded on to our string to make all SMILES strings the same length.
